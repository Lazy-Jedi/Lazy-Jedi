Following settings can be edited in the Project Setup Window:
* Product Icon
* Cursor Image
* Cursor Hotspot (only visible if you have a cursor image)
* Company Name
* Product Name
* Project Folders (Editable List and the Folders are only created if you click the "**Create Folders**" button)

The Company name and the Folders List is serialized to a .json file on your Machine.<br>
You can find that file at Application.persistentPath + /Uee/LazyJedi

The tool does come with an "Auto Save" feature that will automatically save your settings everytime you make a change to the Folders List or Company name.
However, if you are not using Auto Save, please use the **"Save Settings"** Button.
